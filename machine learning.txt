Day 4: Logistic regression
Modelling Binary Logistic Regression Using Pyton :pythoncore-mlseupervised

Other files are also availabe here


Supervised Learning-why is clearly known.input and output is available.so prediction can be checked
Unsupervised Leaning-unlabelled data.No idea what to find from an information.Purpose is to convert unlabelled data to labelled data
Reinforcement learning- with a feeback. Eg.game played multiple times.reward based system.

Categorical- binary,multiple

join multiple tabs
drop duplicate columns
drop columns with too many null values as nothing can be done with that useful
fill with mean/median/some other values for columns with lesser number of null values

mean(avg),median(middle value after arranging in asc order),mode(no of times a value occurs.the maximu of that)
SD- deviation from mean value
We can groupby a column and with respect to that see the value for others

classification- to classify
regression- trend increase or decrease
clutering- its unsupervised learing

knn- k nearest neighbours
sleeping algorthimn
woks only when anew point comes in
Can be used for image classification. rarely used for regression.
We already have many classes. When  a new point comes in we have toclassify into on of the classes listed.
Euclavian method
Find the distance between new oint nd all the points
Select k no of points. choose a suitable k. if uchoose k=1,default it will be assigned to 1 point
if 2  classes if you select k=2, then also chance of error
If you select k=3,the nearest 3 points are taken.
K= no of nearest points.Nearest point with more points is choosen as the class
even/odd classification based on no of classes, choose k opposite
ie., even classification, choose k=odd

low value of k= overfitting
k=sqrt(n) --- n is the no of data points
variance- similaarity in data points unlike statistics
hight variance-low bias
low variance-high  bias
bias-error(diff between act and predicted)

In regressio insead of distance,mean is calculated instead of distance
where distance cannot be calculated,hamming  distance is used
color  and shape and size for fruits
if no of favourbl point go  towards the categorizr,will be classifidto that class

eg: colour=yellow and shape=round, might be mango
check for diff k- model tuning
standard for  =5
k small-overfitting
k big- under fitting

X- featues
A,B,C
sepal
petal
Y- ouput

test, train
X train, Y train, X test, Y test
test should contain all classes. through tuning,cross validation, model tuning to improve
test=20
train=80

train and then test for accuracy


1.normalize to 0 to 1(  when distancecalculated,will not look gud on graph.)-pre-step
1,20,40
x/xmax
1/40,20/40,40/40

to ompact data. will be  done on feature not  on target
normalization one o  types of standardization

A,B,C--- classes
0,1,2

import numpy
np.array[X_test]

treat data- fill missing values
split data
fit
predict
test	
correlatin
confusion matrix
[TP  FP
 FN  tn]
algorithm tuning-iteration for selcting k

a,b,c- 3 CONFUSON MATRIX

a=TN+TP/ TP+TN+F+FN
precision =tp/tp+fp
recall =tp/tp+fn

FP is more dangerous than FN  in example

Methods to boost accuracy
1.more data
2.treat overleirs
3.feature engneering-normalization
4. feature selection
5.multiple algorithms
6.algorithm tuning- k value changed
7. Ensemble methods- bagging.boosting
8.Cross validation - differentiated test size,change test and train size to increase accuracy,k value changed

One hot shot encoding

Label Encoding

Regression:

simple regression:
y=mx+c
Linear - 
straight line 
all points   lie on straight line
for negative line,m will be negative, if it is a line parallel to x axis y=c,slope=0
Non-Linear

logistic regreesion

derived fom linear regression
turns into sigmoid function
for binary classification
basic calclation is probablity function
output>0.5 poitive <0.5 negative
outcme is yes or no. dont use for multiclasses
1/1+e^-y

Dimesnsionality Reduion:
by reducing no of columns
correlated colunms combined to one- unsupervised learnin-pca- no info loss should be there though we are combing
%variationexplained should be same
